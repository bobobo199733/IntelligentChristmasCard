1) Create QR-Codes for desired Christmas Carols/Song/Wishes.
2) Create the Intelligent Christmas Card (look at the PNGs in this project for a better example).
3) (Optional) In order to recognise only your QR-Codes, you can add the links that QR-Code redirects to in listaColinde.txt,
   otherwise you can remove the "database" check-out for valid QR-Codes. 
4) You need to have the mp3 file for your carol, song or wish in order to play it with mixer, because I developed it on a Rb Pi 400,
   using vlc for playing the music from a link like Youtube or other websites for music/video music throws me an : "No memory" error.
   But feel free to change it to vlc (pip/pip3 install python-vlc). 
5) Run the FelicitareCraciun.py script (sudo python/python3 FelicitareCraciun.py) and voil√†. :)



Hope that you enjoyed it,
