1) Create QR codes for desired Christmas Carols/Song/Wishes.
2) Create the Intelligent Christmas Card (look at the PNGs in this project for a better example).
3) (Optional) To recognize only your QR Codes, you can add the links that QR Code redirects to in listaColinde.txt,
   otherwise you can remove the "database" check-out for valid QR codes. 
4) You need to have the mp3 file for your Carol, song or wish to play it with a mixer, because I developed it on a RB Pi 400,
   using VLC for playing the music from a link like Youtube or other websites for music/video music throws me an: "No memory" error.
   But feel free to change it to VLC (pip/pip3 install python-vlc). 
5) Run the FelicitareCraciun.py script (sudo python/python3 FelicitareCraciun.py) and voil√†. :)
